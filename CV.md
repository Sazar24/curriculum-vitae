## About me:  

Developer by passion (i.e. I do it, because I like it).  
I programmed a lot in JavaScript / TypeScript - I actually started with web projects. However, I also gained experience in e2e tests (Selenium) and automation.  
The last one (automation) is closely related to learning Python, which charmed me :)  
Since I got "Clean Code" (Robert C. Martin) book, I focus and do my best to write clean and readable code. "Code should be like a story".  

## Hobbies: 
 - programming 
 - keyboard/piano playing   
 - fantasy book stories (reading mostly B. Sanderson and T.Pratchett)   
 - WoW
 - Calisthenics (physical exercises and health)
